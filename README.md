# inputSeven
javascript widget to input letters in various orders and lengths

Created this for a word game.  Only seven letters are allowed (hence
the name "inputSeven").  The size of the input area is fixed, this is
not a very flexible widget.  But it was simple and did what I needed
at the time.

Published on github in case it is useful as a starting point to
anyone else.

See index.html for an example on how to use this.
